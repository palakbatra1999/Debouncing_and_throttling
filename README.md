# Debouncing_and_throttling

Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, that it stalls the performance of the web page. In other words, it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked.

Debouncing in JavaScript is a practice used to improve browser performance. There might be some functionality in a web page that requires time-consuming computations. If such a method is invoked frequently, it might greatly affect the performance of the browser, as JavaScript is a single-threaded language. 


Throttling or sometimes also called throttle function is a practice used in websites. Throttling is used to call a function after every millisecond or a particular interval of time only the first click is executed immediately.

Letâ€™s see, what will happen if the throttle function is not present on the web page. Then the number of times a button is clicked the function will be called the same number of times. Consider the example.

Without throttling Function: In this code suppose the button is clicked 500 times then the function will be clicked 500 times this is controlled by a throttling function.
